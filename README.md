## Security

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. To access protected endpoints, you need to include the JWT token
in the Authorization header of your requests:

Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

To obtain a token, use the `/api/auth/authenticate` endpoint with your username and password.
